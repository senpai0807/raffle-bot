### Purpose
- I created this CLI application for a friend, but I figured I'd also open source it for people that are needing a template to create a CLI bot and it has your standard features for a sneaker bot such as Proxy Usage/Testing, Webhook Usage/Testing, and it utilizes Got for all HTTP requests, you could really distribute it how it is, you simply you just have to add a licensing feature.

- ## Contribution
- - You are more than welcomed to pull this Git to make it your own, like I've stated, I made it for a friend and have no personal interest or use for it.
